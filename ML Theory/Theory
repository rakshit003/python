#### Supervised Learning:
      Supervised learning is learning from a training set of labelled examples by a knowlegeble external superviser
      Each example is a description of a situation together with lable or action system should take in that situation
      The objective of this learning generalize its response so that it acts correctly in situation not present in the training set

#### Unsupervised Learning:
      It is typically about finding structure hidden in collection of unlabelled data

#### Reinforcement Learning:
      RL is learning from agent environment interactions and the goal is to maximize a numerical reward signal
      Learner is not told which action to take but instead must discover what actions yield the most reward by trying them.

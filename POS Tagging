##Parts-of-speech tagging
Transition counts:
    The first dictionary is the transition_counts dictionary which computes the number of times each tag happened next to another tag.
        In order for you to compute equation 1, you will create a transition_counts dictionary where
        The keys are (prev_tag, tag)
        The values are the number of times those two tags appeared in that order.
        
Emission counts:
    The second dictionary you will compute is the emission_counts dictionary. This dictionary will be used to compute:
    (tag, word)

Tag counts:
    The last dictionary you will compute is the tag_counts dictionary.
    The key is the tag, The value is the number of times each tag appeared.
    

emission_counts: maps (tag, word) to the number of times it happened.
transition_counts: maps (prev_tag, tag) to the number of times it has appeared.
tag_counts: maps (tag) to the number of times it has occured

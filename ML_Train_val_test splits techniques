/*****************Stratified kfold techniques**************/
# Stratified K Fold file SPlit
#Aim is to create a file train_fold.csv from train.csv . train_fold file is same
# as train but the data is shuffeled and it has a new column kfold
# kfold file will have equal class distributtion in each fold

import pandas as pd
from sklearn import model_selection
df=pd.read_csv(r"<path>\train.csv")

##initialize new column kfold
df["kfold"]=-1

##randomize the rows of the data
df=df.sample(frac=1).reset_index(drop=True)

#initiate kfold from model_selection class

kf=model_selection.StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5) #number of kfolds=5

#define the target on which to distribute the folds equally
y=df.Class.values  # for normal kfold we don't need to specify the target class

#fill in new column
for fold,(trn_,val_) in enumerate(kf.split(X=df,y=y)):
    df.loc[val_,'kfold']=fold

df.to_csv(r"<path>\train_kfold.csv")
